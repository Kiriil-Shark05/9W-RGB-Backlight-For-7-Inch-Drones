# Crazy_Leds

## Overview

Crazy_Leds is the powerful 6W RGB individually addresible led lighing designed for 7 inch quadcopters. 
If you fell that regular led strip brings not enough light and power - this is very good choise for you. 
Crazy_leds is very useful in many applications: night time flying, maintaing the orientaintion of the craft, separating you from the competition. 
And it just looks amazing!

## Hardware

The project includes two types of PCBs: main PCB and PDBs. 
Let's look at each type in detail:



### Main PCB
Main PCB is the lighting board itself. It based on 3W RGB LEDs. 
Here is some specifications of them:

Another important component is WS2811 LED driver. It drives the LEDs and makes the lighting individually addressable. Thanks to the LED driver, we can change the color and brightness of every particular LED by a single data line. There is also opportinity (написать, что можно соеденять линии данных между собой)
